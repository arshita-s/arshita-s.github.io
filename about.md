I am a twenty-year-old university student living in San Joaquin County, California. I am passionate about the intersection of public policy and technology in the digital age.

During the academic year, in addition to participating in my classes, I compete with my university's [speech and debate team](https://liberalarts.pacific.edu/liberalarts/academics/departments-and-programs/communication/student-experience/pacific-speech-and-debate-team). We travel the country to debate other teams from other schools about domestic policy, foreign policy, philosophy, ethics, and more. This year, 2021, will be my eighth as a competitive debater. 

On my free time, I like reading comics and graphic novels or playing video games. I also take time out of my week to be a volunteer-activist for the ACLU and Amnesty International.
